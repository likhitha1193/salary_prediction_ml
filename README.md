A predictive regression system that estimates professional compensation by analyzing experience, education, and industry trends using Machine LearningThis project implements a Regression-based Machine Learning pipeline to predict annual salaries based on professional demographics and experience. I began by performing Exploratory Data Analysis to identify key salary drivers, such as years of experience, education level, and geographic location. The data was meticulously cleaned by handling outliers and using Target Encoding or One-Hot Encoding to process high-cardinality categorical variables like job titles. I evaluated multiple regression models—including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Regressors—optimizing for Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared values to ensure the most accurate predictions. The resulting model provides a data-driven tool for job seekers and recruiters to estimate fair market compensation.
